# TooManySuits

A [More Suits](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/x753/More_Suits/) addon that adds pages to the suit rack.

Includes in-world buttons, compatible with
[LCVR](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DaXcess/LethalCompanyVR/)
and controllers.

## Frequently asked questions

- I can't click the buttons

  Use your interact key (E by default, or Right Trigger on controllers)

- The suits appear all on one page

  This is most likely because another mod is crashing before TooManySuits had a chance to execute. Examine your logs and look out for any errors, even if they seem unrelated.
