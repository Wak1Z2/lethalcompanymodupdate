# Jetpack Warning

A Lethal Company mod that adds visual and audio indicators for when your jetpack may explode.  
This is an up-to-date fork of the original mod by klepticat, which is no longer maintained by them.

This is a client side mod, so everyone who wants this feature needs to install this mod.

## Extra: other jetpack mods I recommend
- [JetpackFallFix by Hamunii](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Hamunii/JetpackFallFix/) - Fixes buggy jetpack fall damage logic, utilizing slight but necessary creative freedom.
- [JetpacksCarryBigItems by Hamunii](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Hamunii/JetpacksCarryBigItems/) - Allows the use of the jetpack while holding a two handed item.
