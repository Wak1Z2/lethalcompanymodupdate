## v1.1.0
- Now checks if agent is on navmesh and only counts errors when not on nav mesh or links.
- Reasonable has been reduced down to 8 from 16 erros before triggering the kill code.
- Added new option to attempt relocation instead of killing when an enemy errors. This option will search 50 units for a navmesh and will kill if it cannot be found in that range. This is now the default.


## v1.0.0 Release 
- Initial Release
