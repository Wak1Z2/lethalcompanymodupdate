## Config
In the config you can change the amount of credits the bodies are worth, the weight of the bodies, if the bodies are one-handed or two-handed and which mobs can spawn bodies **(modded enemies are supported)**.\
**This mod does not and will never support the following enemies: Butler and Earth Leviathan.**\
Even enemies that aren't normally killable have bodies/drops, this was done in case someone created a mod capable of killing those enemies.\
**If you don't have ways to kill the vanilla unkillable enemies, those bodies/drops will be unobtainable.**

## Known Issues
- The configs are not fully synced, so please make sure all players have the same configs.
