# Pocket Rooms - MelanieMelicious v1.0.3
### <i>WOW pocket rooms get their own mod, and are better now! Oh and more than one now. ONLY UPDATE/ADD ON NEW SAVES! Adds pocket room doors that you (and enemies) can enter! Perfect for when wider 3-story ship with extended catwalk is still too small. You can find me in the Lethal Company Modding Discord.</i>

## IMPORTANT!!
You can build in the rooms, but to bring furniture inside, you have to walk into the doors while holding furniture, instead of interacting with the doors.

## Rooms:
| Name| Default Price| Description|

| StockRoom0 | 500 | The original pocket room! A basic empty storage room with 2 pre-placed shelves. |
