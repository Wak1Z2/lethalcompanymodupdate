## 1.0.3

* Updated to use latest netcode patcher.
* Migrated to use DawnLib.

## 1.0.2

* Added config to disable walk-in teleports when build mode is not active.
* Added scan nodes to room light switches.

## 1.0.1

* You can no longer (normally) bring the same room's door inside itself, either resulting in death or partial softlock. You can still bring other pocket room doors into different ones.

## 1.0.0

* Initial release and separation from Utility Furniture.
* Added StockRoom0, and BedRoom0-1
* You can now directly bring and build with furniture inside the pocket rooms (you need to walk into door with furniture instead of interacting, to bring it).
* Enemies can now follow you into, and path around the pocket rooms. Enemies can be blacklisted by type to be unable to use doors.
* Rooms now come with their own light switch.
* You can now configure material and colors for the room floors and walls.
* Items should now stay in rooms when reloading/rejoining an existing save, instead of teleporting back to ship.
