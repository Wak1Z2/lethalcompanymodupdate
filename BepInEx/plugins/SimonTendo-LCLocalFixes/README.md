## COMPANY-MANDATED MESSAGE:
<i>Hi, I'm hijacking the introduction message.
<br>
<br>This is not so much a "mod" as it is a collection of ideas/changes/solutions to bugs/oddities/things-that-bothered-me in vanilla Lethal Company and other mods. I used to only have this running locally, as it is client-side and I find interfering with otherwise non-issues quite rude, but the Artifice-tweak might actually save some performance in my friend group for people who... kind of desperately need it.
<br>
<br>All changes can be found on this mod's Wiki page. There might be some stuff in here that helps you too. There might be some stuff in here that other mods made by smarter people very likely already fix (go download those). But I never intended to release this, hence the "Local" in the name, so right now it's just whatever I've come across and wanted changed when playing. So sorry if there's either more or less than you'd want to see, I primarily just quickly released this for my friends.
<br>
<br>That's all. Don't forget to have fun, above all.</i>
