# MaskedInvisFix (Used to be called MaskedFixes)

## Bugs Fixed in this mod
+ [MaskedInvisibilityFix] - when a player died, Masked would often go invisible due to a bug in the vanilla method "MaskedPlayerEnemy.SetVisibilityOfMasked". I have modified this method and the invisibility on player death issue no longer occurs.

## If you wish to use these fixes in your own mod (or improve upon them, or update them because i likely wont)
go for it!, just please let people know your patch is the same as mine (or an improvement) and reference this mod so they know not to use mine.

## Other bugs relating to masked invisibility need fixing?
