## 1.1.1
- Added an option to disable some advantages that custom tooltips offer (like showing enemy HP or [Near activity detected] for outdoor enemies) to make it fair with vanilla clients.
- Fixed an issue where a custom tooltip would permanently stay on-screen when you died, depending on the context.

## 1.1.0
- Added custom tooltips and tooltip colors. This is off by default and can be turned on in the mod's config. Other configuation options may come in a future update. For more details on the tooltip changes, see the README.
