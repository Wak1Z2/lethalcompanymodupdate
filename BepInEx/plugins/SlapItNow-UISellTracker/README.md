UI version of the [SellTracker](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/NutNutty/SellTracker/) mod

Displays how fulfilled the quota is, as well as the expected overtime bonus in the corner of your screen at the Company building.
These values update as items are placed on the counter.

Best used with with the [GrabToSell](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Nexor/GrabToSell/) mod.

Item value desyncs are a thing so expect inacurracies.
