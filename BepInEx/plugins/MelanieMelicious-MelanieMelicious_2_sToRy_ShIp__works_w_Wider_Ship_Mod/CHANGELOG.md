- Added config to fully cover second floor, besides stair entry.
- Fixed navmesh issues resulting in enemies unable to path to second wider 2-story roof.
- Fixed material mismatch on ship walls when windows are disabled.

## 2.0.4
- Offmeshlinks connecting to moon ground now use raycasts tracked on every land to allow enemy navigation on moons to be more compatible with larger ship size.
- Added offmeshlink (also using raycast) to front of ship to allow extra compatibility on moons.
- Updated navmesh blacklist (still defaulted false for now).

## 2.0.3
- Fixed non-wider 2 story having random extended walls outside, and awkward sharp corner in stairs.
- Added secondary rail base to cover ship ribs on wider 2-story default ship layout.
- Thickened front wall to hide open doors.
- Moved walls previously offset by 0.1 from original position, hiding lightswitch, etc.
- Fixed wall window holes to properly fit Ship Windows' windows without stealing all our oxygen. (I noticed wall clipping through frame, but have to fix later. Other fixes important to upload.)
- Moved left window position.
- Door panel placement config reset #2. Last one for now, sorry.

## 2.0.2
- Reset outdated door panel config.

- Fixed non-wider 2-story 2nd floor mansion-style rails not appearing.
- Moved default charger position for wider 2-story.

## 2.0.0
- Added "ship layout" config, exclusive to Wider + 2-Story ship, which allows you to switch between premade ship interior "room/wall" layouts for first and second floor (only 2 right now). Default layout changed, legacy (old) layout still available in config.
- Fully remade models of ships (should fix a handful of minor visual issues, like holes in ship stealing all our oxygen, and messed up textures).
- Ship surface audio is now automatically decided by object's "main" material.
- Ship hull and inside surface audios are now separate (you're WELCOME s1ckboy, smh, hates wood sound on metal roof).
- (Hopefully) Fixed ship door randomly turning players into mimes for a period of time, on Oxyde (some tests, but bug was random, so I could just be lucky).
- Fixed default ship style's floor lines not properly aligning cut-off section when using Ship Windows' floor window.
- Moved default door button panel position overwrite.

## 1.2.9
- Fixed updating offmeshlinks for old ship ladders (according to one test), which allowed some enemies to cheat into the ship. Doesn't affect moons not following vanilla scene ship navmesh hierchy.

## 1.2.8
- (Re)Added config to disable navmesh regen IN ALL CASES except if listed moon is on navmesh regen whitelist. Defaulted to false due to horrendous wait times, and sometimes even disallowing players (pacoito) to play on some packs.

## 1.2.7
- Adjusted ship navmesh to close off open corners in ship.
- Added 62 Lithium to navmesh regen blacklist.

## 1.2.6

## 1.2.2
- Moved catwalk-to-ship navlink to prevent enemies bypassing closed doors.

## 1.2.1
- Separated and properly labelled new ship navmesh surfaces. This should hopefully fix old birds landing inside the ship, and giants entering through open doors.
- Added navlink to invisble "nerf" navsection on wider 2-story ship, when enabled.

## 1.2.0
- Complete rework of navmesh (thank you XuXiaolan and fumo). Most moons no longer regenerate navmesh (faster loading). Some moons previously navmesh incompatible should now work with custom navmesh. And now ship can carry enemies when leaving! 😀
- Added color config for ship map icon (client-sided).
- Fixed ship map icon for v70 update.
- Removed deprecated navmesh blacklist config.

## 1.1.12

## 1.1.1

- POTENTIALLY fixed magnet position change desync.

## 0.3.0
- Added config to add a third floor (crazy), alongside window configs for the floor.

- Did something to test fixing material transparency when decaling the ship. Didn't actually test it.

## 0.2.4

## 0.2.3
- Fixed ship overlap occuring when getting fired and (hopefully) when buying windows with multiple players while Ship Windows is enabled.
- Fixed ladder nodes so enemies such as eyeless dogs can more easily enter the ship (you're in danger).

- Potentially fixed (based on like 1 test) Lethal Posters breaking the game when used with these mods. Posters still don't appear, but it saves people the trouble.
- Split main ship prefab parts into (more) sections to allow more versatility in changing sections (great for custom external mod compatibility).
Main section names are: Floor0, Roof0, Wall0, Wall1, Wall2, Wall3, Detail, and Catwalk. Parented under MelanieShip.

## 0.1.1
