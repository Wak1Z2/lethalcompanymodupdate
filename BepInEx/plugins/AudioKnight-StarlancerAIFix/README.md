# Starlancer AI Fix
A helper mod that automatically assigns the correct interior or exterior AI to an enemy when they spawn depending on if they are inside or outside of the dungeon, and adjusts certain behaviors so that they act appropriately. Also fixes a null reference exception regarding EnableEnemyMesh(). Part of my Starlancer Series!

By default, Hoarding Bugs will not pick up Circuit Bee Hives. This is toggleable in the configuration file. This feature is BLACKLISTED from the following moons: Wesley's 58 Hyve | Generic's 72 Collateral
